Since my formal education — much to my preference — was more focused on the theoretical aspects of computer science, I realize that I still lack some practical knowledge and professional experience. At the moment I am working on this by looking for a job in industry. But I don't think this is sufficient.

<blockquote>
“Erfahrung heißt gar nichts. Man kann seine Sache auch 35 Jahre schlecht machen.” <br>
Translated: <i>Experience means nothing. One can do a bad job for as long as 35 years.</i>
</blockquote>
 After the German writer <i>Kurt Tucholsky.</i>

This is quite the statement but (as always) there is also a bit of truth. (That doesn't mean one should take such famous quotes seriously. They may sound nice but it's random if they really apply. I never even read something by Tucholsky although I'm German.) Therefore, I'm trying to not only learn from practice but supplementary from the books of seasoned professionals that are widely acclaimed. For a list of such books I just googled `software engineering must read`. How trite! Here are some results:

But enough chitchat. Let's take a look at the book in question!

## General overview

*The Passionate Programmer* by Chad Fowler is not about Software Development per se. It is about the respective career path. An important quote from the official description is:

> You’ll learn how to build your software development career step by step, following the same path that you would follow if you were building, marketing, and selling a product. After all, your skills themselves are a product.

It's a short book of only 232 pages from 2009. There are 53 chapters of advice. Each chapter is accompanied by some kind of exercises called “Act on It” (try out technologies you dislike, take notes of your activities, work on open source stuff, start a blog...).

## Opinion

Since I have a background in business most of the advice isn't new for me. But for an aspiring software developer this might be a good read to get an overview of useful areas of expertise outside of pure technical skill. This book might not be eye-opening. *Of course*, it's good to be proactive. *Of course*, it's better to work with the management instead of against it. *Of course*, people need to know about your achievements to appreciate them. Strangely enough, in reality there are a lot of people who don't do this and if you just integrate in such a workplace you will do the same. For me, this book is more of a reminder that it's indeed possible to do good work; even if it means — this is the last chapter — to *Go Independent*.

Now for my criticism. Yes, this is not a technical book. It is more of a specialized business guide. And it is written in a really casual style and is full of anecdotes. This in itself is no problem but most of the advice is based on anecdotal evidence. The author talks about his personal experience, about common sense and about the similarities between working as a saxophonist and as a software developer. His advice *might* be correct but it could also be wrong. Even though it sounds convincing and even though I can identify with many of his narratives (might be because of their generality) it's important to stay skeptical. 

## Lessons I learned

As I already wrote, most of the content was more of a reminder for me. But some parts turned out to be really inspirational for me personally.

### Don’t Listen to Your Parents

    The famous legend of Icarus who ignored his fathers warnings and flew too high… And as a result fell to his death. Some see him as a fool, for others he’s a hero.

Why didn't someone tell this sooner to me? For me my parents are experienced and intelligent people who are more often right than wrong. But of course their experience is limited to their living environment! Why should they know about working with modern technology? Sure, there are some general rules independent of industry. But at large this is not something one can develop a general intuition for. It's the same as with quotations from famous people. Yes, these are people who are more intelligent and more successful. Doesn't mean everything out of their mouth is concentrated truth! The accuracy of advice is somehow randomly distributed; like many things in the real world. So there's no reason why parents' advice should be more valuable. Naturally, this also doesn't mean to disregard everything from the beginning. But a bit of own thinking and trying things out doesn't hurt.

### Making the Hang

This is my favorite chapter! It tells about the author's friend. A youngster musician who would always seek the presence of the renowned and skilled musicians. Now the author asks the same things that would run through my head:

> Wasn't he annoying these poor musicians? They were taking a break, for God's sake. They didn't want to talk to this damned kid!

But as it turns out they didn't mind! And this approach proved really successful! I don't know if I would be able to do the same but maybe I can just try it out. It's a bit embarrassing but it's also a good opportunity to face these negative emotions and to get out of my comfort zone. Arranging such a situation is therefore something I'm working on at the moment.

### Go Independent

I never really considered this before at my current experience level. But now this is my plan B, shouldn't I find an appropriate occupation. Sure, there are many things I don't know. But for others it's the same, although they have a regular job. And there are things I know that others don't. I'd like to learn more about teamwork in the software sector but going independent doesn't necessarily mean working alone. Yes, it might prove quite interesting to be "the outsider". I also have some general business knowledge so the organizational stuff should work out somehow, I think.

It can be something easy like creating web pages or working as contractor. Or my own PropTech startup I can wreck. (I already got some ideas; but idea and execution are different pairs of shoes.) And since we're getting [unrealistic](https://www.unrealengine.com/): My own super-successful video game. :godmode: The possibilities are endless.

## Afterword: Why this cover image?

The image at the top shows quite a funny legend from Roman mythology. It's about Vulcan, the old guy on the right who's incidentally the god of fire and metalworking, and his wife Venus, the goddess of beauty who's quite unfaithful (here in bed with Mars, god of war). But it's totally not her fault! She was forcefully married to Vulcan and he's a really boring guy. The legend itself goes a bit different but here it seems like he's some nerd who's that immersed in his work that he doesn't even realize that he is cheated on literally right behind his back.

If someone dogmatically follows all the advice from the book, he'll really turn into such a workaholic. I'm also prone to this. But although I sympathize with Vulcan, I certainly don't want to slip into his shoes.
