Some months ago I was writing messages with an online acquaintance I know from a German anime forum that's shut down by now. Let's call him *Mr. Berg*. During that time I was also working on [my Bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/leyhline/vix-term-structure/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf) about [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) (some trendy machine learning method). I was also thinking about applying these techniques on anime stuff just for the fun of it. These models can have an arbitrarily large input and/or output. Meaning: It's perfectly possible to generate whole images using Deep Learning.

I was already planning on collecting data (i.e. anime pictures) and throwing it at some standard models like Google's classical [DeepDream](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html). Long-term goal is of course to generate professional-quality artwork just from a few keywords but that's far from possible at the moment. Fortunately Mr. Berg had a problem that might be easily solvable with today's technology. If you ever read this: I really owe you one for this idea. It's right in the scope of what I can accomplish with my limited resources.

## Problem description

Mr. Berg is a diehard fan of an anime called [Coppelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9479/Coppelion). The series has quite an interesting look but at the end it only received mixed reviews. Therefore not much merchandise is available. By stalking the the staff's twitter or something he got some small sample pictures of official artwork.

<figure>
    {% assign sample_width = "130px" %}
    {% assign sample_display = "inline" %}
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/sample1.jpg" alt="Coppelion sample 1" style="max-width:{{ sample_width }};display:{{ sample_display }};">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/sample3.jpg" alt="Coppelion sample 2" style="max-width:{{ sample_width }};display:{{ sample_display }};">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/sample4.jpg" alt="Coppelion sample 2" style="max-width:{{ sample_width }};display:{{ sample_display }};">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/sample6.jpg" alt="Coppelion sample 2" style="max-width:{{ sample_width }};display:{{ sample_display }};">

Looking at these pictures one can't help but notice a few things:
* They are damn small (the original resolution is 233x330 pixels).
* There is a large **SAMPLE** watermark.
* All images have exactly the same watermark.

Well, that's obviously too small for printing a poster or ordering a custom [Dakimakura](http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/1646/Dakimakura.html) (you might not to want to click on this link while at work). What we need to do is:

### 1. Remove the watermark

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/sample2.jpg" alt="Coppelion sample 2" style="max-width:40%;display:inline-block;">
    <p style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;font-size:5em;">➧</p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/clean2.jpg" alt="Coppelion cleaned sample 2" style="max-width:40%;display:inline-block;">
    <figcaption>
    This watermark got removed by hand by Mr. Berg himself. He asserted that he has no artistic talent whatsoever.

Depending on the level of detail of the specific image this might be possible for any human with basic Photoshop skills. But it's very time consuming since every line and every color has to be chosen carefully.

For a computer it's possible, too. If the computer can distinguish the watermark from the picture itself it can look at the surrounding pixels and with some mathematical optimization incrementally remove parts of the watermark until it's gone completely. [Google had a nice paper about this last year](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/making-visible-watermarks-more-effective.html). 
Unfortunately this approach won't work in our case since there are neither enough images with an identical watermark to make distinction possible, nor is it unobtrusive enough. You see, it's <span style="font-size:1.5em;">large</span> and **bold** and <span style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #f00;">glowing</span>! This makes it hard to get things right if you only look at some numbers in a small surrounding area. It might be easier if the computer *knows* that it's supposed to draw some anime girls.

### 2. Enlarge without loss of quality

This is supposedly solved by [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/) which also uses Deep Learning for upscaling anime pictures. It's very popular in the community.

The paper presenting the underlying theory itself is from 2015. By now there might be some more advanced techniques and models. That's something I have to explore at a later time.

But what's important to realize is the limit of super-resolution. Scaling the image up too much is like drawing something completely new. A flower seen from afar might just be a blob of color in our eyes. But up close it's a complex organic life form where every petal has it's own highly individual texture and shape. *A Flower Is Not A Flower*. If we were to draw these details on our own without looking at reality, where would the necessary information come from?

## Approach

The main component will of course be aforementioned *Deep Learning*. I don't want to go into details because if you already know about it superficial explanations will only bore you. And if you're here for anime you surely want to know about [applications](http://deeplearninggallery.com/), not about technical details. Just as much: Such models take some data as input, do a whole lot of calculations and return the result. The important part is that these calculations are purely *learned*. At first the model returns only rubbish and if you continue to train it with random data this won't change. But if there's a pattern the results will improve considerably in a short amount of time of maybe a few weeks (easier problems won't take that much time; like some hours). Without programming, manual rules… Just by throwing data at it like an idiot. It's great! 

The more complicated the pattern the harder it is to learn. Sounds logical but it's often not clear which problems are fit for Deep Learning. My favorite rule of thumb is from the book "Deep Learning". Yes, the title's slightly presumptuous (even their domain name is [deeplearningbook.org](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)) but it's a most recommendable read!

> Most tasks that consist of mapping an input vector to an output vector, and that are easy for a person to do rapidly, can be accomplished via deep learning, given sufficiently large models and sufficiently large datasets of labeled training examples.

Since even Mr. Berg were able to do this (as seen above) a computer should be easily capable, too. Okay, he couldn't do it *rapidly* but that are minor details.

Therefore we just need a lot of data pairs of images with watermarks and their corresponding clean versions. I already scraped whole [Danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/) (don't go here either if you're currently at work), a large database of 3 million anime pictures with corresponding tags describing the content. There's also a downloadable mirror from [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2017) he prepared independently. This is most kind of him since it took me a whole month downloading all this stuff while putting burden on the server. Now I just need to place some watermarks on these pictures, match them accordingly and throw them at my supercomputer. Then I'll also incorporate a popular model for super-resolution and I'm done. According to hearsay it's also favorable to train one model at multiple tasks jointly because bidirectional transfer of learning happens.

## Challenges

Unfortunately there are some problems at the supercomputer part. Since I lost my primary source of computational power I have to resort to some hacker tricks and get distributed learning to work. This is not trivial since the optimization algorithms normally aren't suited for this. I'll write a more technical post about this in the future. It will be just like that one time in *To Aru Kagaku no Railgun* where this peculiar scientist woman connects the brains of thousands of people to do a few calculations. Additionally she receives super powers.

Furthermore I have no idea how to extract the watermark in a straightforward way. But that's a problem for the future.

## Afterword: About Paul Cézanne

This is the artist behind this post's cover image. Needless to say that I've never heard of him before. But what I read about the painting at the [Metropolitian Museum of Art's website](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435867) is quite funny:

> Although fascinated by the nude human figure, the artist worked slowly and was uncomfortable with female models, so he derived such scenes from his imagination…

I can relate to this! But what's more important, that's what I'm trying to do. Teaching a computer concepts to imitate human cognition and feign imagination. What more are these failed results of Generative Adversarial Networks than *Impressionism by Machines*?
