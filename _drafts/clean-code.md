Following up on my last book review I'd like to go a bit more into technical details this time by writing about *Clean Code*. On the one hand this is a well-known book by Robert C. Martin (nicknamed Uncle Bob), on the other hand this is a concept about writing maintainable and easy to read code. These are widespread ideas in programming and by simply searching one can find lots of blogs, explanations, initiatives etc. There are even some articles that claim that this is [THE book every programmer should read](https://hackernoon.com/the-book-every-programmer-should-read-33b5ef2e532a).

I just started out with my first job but I did a lot of programming during my time at university. I also read about some concepts and had lectures with given coding styles and style checkers and all that stuff. My grades were good and I had the feeling that I was a better programmer than most of my fellow students. Still, I had the feeling that I was lacking something in general. This book helped me realize! Now I just have to implement these lessons in my day job (punchline at the end).

## The book

The book's from 2009 and has 462 pages in total. Its catchphrase is:

>Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional.
>There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

There are 17 chapters. The first chapters is about the definition of clean code and some introductory musings. Chapter 2 to 13 contains all the advice with examples and explanations. Up to chapter 16 it's about successive refinement — one of the core principles — by example and last but not least (I always wanted to use this phrase!) chapter 17 contains a long overview over possible code smells. Nice!

### Opinion

It hurts my hipster soul to agree with the consensus but **this is a must read**. Before I thought I was so clever and gifted. Now I feel dumb. That's perfect! I love this feeling! And what's most impressive: This book isn't about complicated and abstract ideas. It's about the uninspired technical parts of programming. It's written to be useful. Nevertheless, it changed the way I look at code. Might be my lacking experience but I'm deeply impressed such a book could affect me this much.

Of course this doesn't mean one has to agree with everything. I'm still no clean code zealot. (I think?)

## Case study

## Punchline: Clean Code in Industry

After finishing this book I was eager to start writing clean code and I was hoping to learn from industry professionals about good object-oriented design, flexible software architecture, efficient team work. Well… even if these can not be learned from books alone I realized that pure practical experience does not necessarily teach about these things either. Could've stayed at university at this rate. :suspect:
