I've been reading lots of books during April. Maybe a bit too many since I didn't take enough time to reflect upon the stuff I read or even apply this newfound knowledge. If anything, after reading all this stuff about object-oriented programming in C++/Java/C#, design patterns (I even read the classical book by the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)) and testing I nearly forgot how to use techniques from the functional paradigm. I did some really embarrassing stuff trying to wrap TensorFlow's high-level API (Estimators and Datasets) in Python by using inheritance instead of just passing around functions. Good thing I also read a book about Lua — a highly dynamic programming language — as reminder what's possible when you're not bound to one paradigm. But that's something for another time.

Well, it's best to stop reading for the moment and start doing. But to conclude this episode of obsessive reading I'd like to write about one last book that seems to be a real classic:

The book was published in 1999 and has 320 pages. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) has a really nice summary for the book's contents:

> The book does not present a systematic theory, but rather a collection of tips to improve the development process in a pragmatic way. The main qualities of what the authors refer to as a pragmatic programmer are being an early adopter, to have fast adaption, inquisitiveness and critical thinking, realism, and being a jack-of-all-trades…
> [It] uses analogies and short stories to present development methodologies and caveats […].

Well, that's exactly what I wanted to say about this book, too. Glad someone else already did it. There are eight chapters and 70 of aforementioned tips in total. There are also some exercises ("challenges").

## Opinion

This is from the book's website:

> This classic title is regularly featured on software development “Top Ten” lists, and is issued by many corporations to new hires.

When searching for important books in software engineering this was my perception, too. And I can see why. Even tough this book's quite old and many tools mentioned aren't in fashion anymore the tips itself are still useful. If you manage to follow these tips, you are on a good way to become an outstanding programmer (or even a *"Pragmatic Programmer"*).

**Still, I didn't like the book.**

I mean, what's a "Pragmatic Programmer" anyway? The book itself assigns some attributes to this concept like "critical thinking", "realism", etc. (see above). But in my experience this is something almost every programmer ascribes to himself. Like how the majority of car drivers think their driving skill is above average. The same goes for the tips: They aren't very specific and can easily be misunderstood. It's easy to read the book and be inspired but *real understanding* (!) is a different matter.

Maybe this generality is the reason this book is still a good read nearly twenty years after it was published. Nevertheless, I personally like my technical books to be more specific.

## Personal conclusions

When reading the summary from Wikipedia above I realize that my ideal book is the total opposite from this one:

> The book does present a specific systematic theory. The authors argue that in practice this theory might need to be adapted to the specific needs of a project, nevertheless they provide a framework formally describing a style of software development. Instead of analogies and short stories they provide references to scientific studies from various diverse fields.

That sounds awesome, doesn't it?

I think the books from the [Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/) aren't really my style. I like my nonfiction books more formal, often trying to figure out myself how to use the attained insights in the real world.
