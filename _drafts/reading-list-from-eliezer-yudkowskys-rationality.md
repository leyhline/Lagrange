For the last few months I was reading a [free e-book](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/) (although I paid a few bucks) about rationality. The guy who wrote this, Eliezer Yudkowsky, seems to be quite famous in some circles. He also wrote some popular [Harry Potter fanfiction](https://www.hpmor.com/) I never heard about before (I think it's because English is not my native language and we've got lots of German fanfiction ourselves). Well, he certainly likes to write since the book has nearly 2000 pages. I read it at an irregular pace, often setting it aside for shorter books, but at last I'm through. Sadly, I can't give a full review since it would have been necessary to take notes for reminiscing about such a tome. I took notes, yes, but not about its specific contents but about some bibliographical references. (I don't like to get my information from just one source and I also prefer more technical explanations as supplemental.)

Nevertheless, allow me to make a word or two about the book in general.

## General overview

The book is a collection of essays from Yudkowsky, originating from the blogs [Overcoming Bias](https://www.overcomingbias.com/) and [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/). The actual year of publication is 2015 but it contains around 10 years of blog posts.

>What does it actually mean to be rational?
>Not Hollywood-style “rational,” where one rejects all human feeling to embrace Cold Hard Logic — real rationality, of the sort studied by psychologists, social scientists, and mathematicians.
>The kind of rationality where you make good decisions, even when it’s hard; where you reason well, even in the face of massive uncertainty; where you recognize and make full use of your fuzzy intuitions and emotions, rather than trying to discard them.

The book is organized into 6 chapters ("books") with different sequences each and each sequence hosts a number of essays.

## Opinion

Okay, he wrote a lot. Surely, I already forgot a large amount. But let me try to summarize this two thousand pages strong book in ten words:

1. LOOK AT YOURSELF
2. LOOK AT REALITY
3. ADJUST YOURSELF TO REALITY

Yudkowsky hat a lot of clever examples and anecdotes. He seems to be an intelligent and charismatic person and therefore everything reads logical and sound. But is he actually right? Well, I won't know just from reading. He himself wrote that one shouldn't just adopt all this rationality stuff without asking questions. What's important is if it really works in reality. Well, I'll try trying it out. Let's see if I fare better.

## Reading List

These are some books I found interesting enough to write down their title. Let's see how many I'll actually read.

* Paul Slovic et al. "Rational actors or rational fools: implications of the affect heuristic for behavioral economics" In: *The Journal of Socio-Economics 31/4* (2002), pp. 329-342.
* Judea Pearl. *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference*. Morgan Kaufmann, 1988.
* David J. C. MacKay. *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*. Cambridge University Press, 2003.
* Robert B. Cialdini. *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*. Harper Collins, 2009. (not sure about this one)
* E. T. Jaynes. *Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*. Cambridge University Press, 2003.
* Max Tegmark. *Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality*. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2014.
* ~~John Kruschke. *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan*. Academic Press, 2014.~~ Cameron Davidson-Pilon's [*Bayesian Methods for Hackers*](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) might be more up my alley.
* I'm also thinking about reading some stuff from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's [*Incerto*](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) like *The Black Swan* or *Antifragile* but I'm a bit afraid these will be similar to Yudkowsky's book. And I don't need to read about things I already know. So maybe I'll take a look at [*The Technical Incerto*](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/FatTails.html) instead.

## Afterword: Why this cover image?

This is just a small part from a large painting you can see at [the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435725). As always, it doesn't have any connection to the topic at hand. I just liked the image of this large hollow head. Maybe because a concept like "rationality" is something from the minds of humans but I'm still not sure if there is some actual significance behind this word. I think I will never really know since I'm human myself, not able to grasp my own thoughts entirely. Fun fact: Obviously, this is a biblical scene. But Yudkowsky does make no secret of his aversion for religion. This could be interpreted like I was threatening him with hellfire for his heresy, though it was just by chance I picked this image (I think).
