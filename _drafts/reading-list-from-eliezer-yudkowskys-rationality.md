For the last few months I was reading a free e-book (altough I paid a few bucks) about rationality. The guy who wrote this, Eliezer Yudkowsky, seems to be quite famous in some circles. He also wrote some popular [Harry Potter fanfiction](https://www.hpmor.com/) I never heard about before (I think it's because English is not my native language and we've got lots of German fanfiction ourself). Well, he certainly likes to write since the book has nearly 2000 pages. I read it at an irregular pace, often setting it aside for shorter books, but at last I'm through. Sadly, I can't give a full review since it would have been necessary to take notes for reminiscing about such a tome. I took notes, yes, but not about its specific contents but about some bibliographical references. (I don't like to get my information from just one source and I also prefer more technical explanations as supplemental.)

Nevertheless, allow me to make a word or two about the book in general.
