For the last few months I was reading a [free e-book](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/) (altough I paid a few bucks) about rationality. The guy who wrote this, Eliezer Yudkowsky, seems to be quite famous in some circles. He also wrote some popular [Harry Potter fanfiction](https://www.hpmor.com/) I never heard about before (I think it's because English is not my native language and we've got lots of German fanfiction ourself). Well, he certainly likes to write since the book has nearly 2000 pages. I read it at an irregular pace, often setting it aside for shorter books, but at last I'm through. Sadly, I can't give a full review since it would have been necessary to take notes for reminiscing about such a tome. I took notes, yes, but not about its specific contents but about some bibliographical references. (I don't like to get my information from just one source and I also prefer more technical explanations as supplemental.)

Nevertheless, allow me to make a word or two about the book in general.

The book is a collection of essays from Yudkowsky, originating from the blogs [Overcoming Bias](https://www.overcomingbias.com/) and [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/). The actual year of publication is 2015 but it contains around 10 years of blog posts.

>What does it actually mean to be rational?
>Not Hollywood-style “rational,” where one rejects all human feeling to embrace Cold Hard Logic — real rationality, of the sort studied by psychologists, social scientists, and mathematicians.
>The kind of rationality where you make good decisions, even when it’s hard; where you reason well, even in the face of massive uncertainty; where you recognize and make full use of your fuzzy intuitions and emotions, rather than trying to discard them.
