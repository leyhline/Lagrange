Since my formal education – much to my preference – was more focused on the theoretical aspects of computer science, I realize that I still lack some practical knowledge and professional experience. At the moment I am working on this by looking for a job in industry. But I don't think this is sufficient.

<blockquote>
“Erfahrung heißt gar nichts. Man kann seine Sache auch 35 Jahre schlecht machen.” <br>
Translated: <i>Experience means nothing. One can do a bad job for even 35 years.</i>
</blockquote>
 After the German writer <i>Kurt Tucholsky.</i>

This is quite the statement but (as always) there is also a bit of truth. (That doesn't mean one should take such famous quotes seriously. They may sound nice but it's random . I never even read something by Tucholsky even though I'm German.) Therefore I'm trying learn from practice but supplementary from the books of seasoned professionals that are widely acclaimed. For a list of such books I just googled `software engineering must read`. How trite! Here are some results:

But enough chitchat. Let's take a look at the book!

## General overview

*The Passionate Programmer* by Chad Fowler is not about Software Development per se. It is about the respective career path. An important quote from the official description is:

> You’ll learn how to build your software development career step by step, following the same path that you would follow if you were building, marketing, and selling a product. After all, your skills themselves are a product.

It's a short book of only 232 pages from 2009. There are 53 chapters of advice. Each chapter is accompanied by some kind of exercises called “Act on It” (try out technologies you dislike, take notes of your activities, work on open source stuff, start a blog...).
