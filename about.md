Hi, I'm Thomas and I like to play around with computers. When I was younger I also wanted to be a mad scientist. (In my imagination this was someone who lumps some chemicals together until everything explodes.) Unfortunately, I never really got into this chemistry stuff. 

Ultimately, what is left is my interest for electronics and mathematics but that should be sufficient for doing science, right? Right? Oh, I also like anime,  ~~video games~~¹ and all this stuff but that should come to no surprise considering my generation. At least this is what I tell myself.

I'd also like to lighten up my posts by some random artwork from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art's Collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection#!?showOnly=openaccess). Many images are released into public domain (that's really nice!) and apart from that it's simply fun to browse their gallery.

¹Update: In November 2018, after finishing *NieR:Automata* which I found to be excellent, I realized that I actually don't like video games that much anymore.
